## Description
RAD Smoothies was built for a midterm full-stack group project. We chose to build a food pick-up ordering interface for a smoothie shop. RAD Smoothies is mobile-first in its design. Thirsty clients can visit our smoothie store and place an order. RAD smoothies communicates with [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)'s REST API. Our customers interact with the web app, whereas the restaurant interface strictly through SMS.

We built a chatbot around researched user stories and prototyped user and restaurant interactions using SMS as an interface (a tech both end-users have). Our chatbot is built to communicate with RAD Smoothie's POST routes in order to retrieve order data from a psql database and serve them back to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)â€™s REST API. tl;dr it is returning some feedback to the user and restaurant based on parsed JSON data.
